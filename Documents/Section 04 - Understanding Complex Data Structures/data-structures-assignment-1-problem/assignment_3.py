# 1) Create a list of “person” dictionaries with a name, age and list of hobbies for each person. Fill in any data you want.

person = {
    {"name": "Alan",
    "age": 45,
    "hobbies": ["Electronics", "Arduino", "Programming"]
    },
    {"name": "Rachel",
    "age": 37,
    "hobbies": ["Baking", "Walking", "Reading"]
    },
    {"name": "Morgan",
    "age": 43,
    "hobbies": ["Walking", "Tinkering", "Fishing"]
    }
    }

print("This is my person dictionary:", person)


# 2) Use a list comprehension to convert this list of persons into a list of names (of the persons).
# 3) Use a list comprehension to check whether all persons are older than 20.
# 4) Copy the person list such that you can safely edit the name of the first person (without changing the original list).
# copied_persons = persons[:]
# 5) Unpack the persons of the original list into different variables and output these variables.
