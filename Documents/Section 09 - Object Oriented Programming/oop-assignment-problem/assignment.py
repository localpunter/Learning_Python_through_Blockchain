# 1) Create a Food class with a “name” and a “kind” attribute as well as a “describe()” method (which prints “name” and “kind” in a sentence).
# 2) Try turning describe() from an instance method into a class and a static method. Change it back to an instance method thereafter.
# 3) Create a  “Meat” and a “Fruit” class – both should inherit from “Food”. Add a “cook()” method to “Meat” and “clean()” to “Fruit”.
# 4) Overwrite a “dunder” method to be able to print your “Food” class.
