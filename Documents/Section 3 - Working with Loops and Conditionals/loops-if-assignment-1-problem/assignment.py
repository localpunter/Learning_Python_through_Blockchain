# 1) Create a list of names and use a for loop to output the length of each name (len()).
# 2) Add an if check inside the loop to only output names longer than 5 characters.
# 3) Add another if check to see whether a name includes a “n” or “N” character.
# 4) Use a while loop to empty the list of names (via pop())
