# Learning_Python_through_Blockchain

- The Documents folder has the course notes from Udemy where I purchased this course.

It is not my course but the Blockchain folder contains my work throughout the course.

You can run multiple nodes through the same PC:

    'python node.py' - This will run the first node and defaults to localhost:5000 in the browser.
    
    'python node.py -p 5001' - This will run the second node on localhost:5001 in the browser.

'-p 50xx' overrides the default 5000 and allows you to set up as many nodes as you want to simulate a blockchain.


Course Content:

Python is probably THE most trending programming language you can learn these days!

It's very popular because it's easy to learn and use, runs on all operating systems and allows you to build a broad variety of programs: Be that web applications, desktop applications, utility scripts or using it for data science and machine learning.

In this course, you'll learn Python from scratch - and you'll do so whilst building your own Blockchain and Cryptocurrency. These are of course also highly trending topics and not a lot of people understand what a Blockchain really is. As a nice side-effect, you will know how a Blockchain works once you completed this course. It's an exciting course project that allows you to learn and apply Python to something you know and you can use.

What's in the course?

- A summary of Python and the Blockchain technology

- All the base Python syntax you need to know (variables, operators, functions, ...)

- Loops and conditional statements

- More complex data structures like tuples or dictionaries

- A closer look at built-in functions and the standard library Python ships with

- String manipulation

- How to work with files

- Error handling

- Debugging

- Object-oriented programming with classes and inheritance

- Internal & external modules (packages)

- How to spin up an Http server with the Flask package

- Handling Http requests (sending & receiving)

And more!

What are the course prerequisites?

NO prior programming knowledge is required
Very basic knowledge about how a computer works will help you though (but can also be built up whilst you're going through the course)
